In this project, we had to model a modified zombie outbreak through a set of equations, as was outlined in the assignment. We had 3 differential equations that told us the evolution of 3 parameters, the number of zombies, the number of survivors that weren't too scared to kill zombies and the number of survivors that hid in a corner. The killers could train scared survivors, the killers could kill zombies, zombies could kill killers and zombies could kill survivors. We used GSL to solve the differential equations.

To run the file, simple type "make all" and the necessary files will be compiled and an output.txt will be produced. The case was run twice, once when all the zombies were killed and another where the zombies won, which is in main.cpp. The two cases are separated in the output file by an extra end of line character. The columns are arranged in the order of: time, number of scared survivors, number of killers and number of zombies. After a few iterations a steady state exists and the numbers don't really change all that much.
