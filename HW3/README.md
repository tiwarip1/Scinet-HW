This directory contains a .tar folder which contains all the necessary files to be run using "g++ -std=c++11". To run this file you can use the makefile located in the .tar folder using the command "make -f makefile.Makefile", which will link all the necessary object files and run the executable itself. The output will be put into a .dat file.

The folder simulates a number of ants that have been divided into square sections of a table and have been allowed to evovle by allowing motion. These ants can fall off of the table and so their numbers reduce in time. Comments are given in the .cpp files to explain their purposes, but the main.cpp file consolidates the functionalities of each file to simulate the ants on a table.
